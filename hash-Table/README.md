## hash Table
- hash method is way to store the data in large table with certain method and it is data structure 
- structure that map key to value.
- Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are always accommodated in some way.
- The efficiency of map depends on the efficiency of hash function.
